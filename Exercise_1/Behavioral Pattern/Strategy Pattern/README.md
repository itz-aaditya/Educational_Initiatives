Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern

Use Case: Allow different robots to have interchangeable behaviors for walking, talking, and flying, and enable changing these behaviors at runtime without modifying the robot classes themselves.

Explanation of the Code:

Strategy Interfaces (WalkableRobot, TalkableRobot, FlyableRobot): Define interchangeable behaviors for robots.

Concrete Strategies: NormalWalk, NoWalk, NormalTalk, NoTalk, NormalFly, NoFly implement the strategy interfaces to provide different behavior variants.

Context (Robot): Maintains references to behavior strategies and delegates actions to them. Allows dynamic behavior changes via setter methods (setWalkBehavior, setTalkBehavior, setFlyBehavior).

Concrete Robots (CompanionRobot, WorkerRobot): Specific robot types that extend Robot and define their own projection() features.

Main Class: Demonstrates robots with different initial behaviors and shows how behaviors can be changed dynamically at runtime (e.g., upgrading a robot to fly or talk).

Key Benefit: The Strategy Pattern allows flexible and reusable behavior selection without altering the robot classes, supporting dynamic modification and cleaner code separation.
